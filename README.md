# winpick.nvim

Plugin that helps with picking windows. This is a fork of [gbrlsnchs/winpick.nvim](https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/winpick.nvim) with `vim.fn.getchar` replaced by `vim.fn.input` to get user input when picking a window. This allows the window picker to be called by a double-click mouse event.

All installation and config options are the same as the original.
